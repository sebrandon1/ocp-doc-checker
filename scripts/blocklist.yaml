# OCP Doc Checker - Repository Blocklist
#
# List repositories (one per line) that should be skipped during org scanning.
# Use the full repository name format: org/repo-name
#
# Example:
#   blocklist:
#     - openshift/some-archived-repo
#     - openshift/repo-with-special-handling
#
# This file can be placed in:
#   1. ~/.config/ocp-doc-scanner/blocklist.yaml (user-level)
#   2. ./scripts/blocklist.yaml (project-level)
#   3. Custom location via --blocklist flag

blocklist:
  # Add repositories to skip below (uncomment and modify examples as needed)
  # - openshift/example-repo-to-skip
  # - openshift/another-repo-to-skip
  - openshift/lightspeed-rag-content
