# OCP Doc Checker - Repository Blocklist Example
#
# This is an example blocklist file showing different ways to specify repositories to skip.
# Copy this file to blocklist.yaml and customize it for your needs.
#
# The script looks for blocklist files in these locations (in order):
#   1. Path specified with --blocklist flag
#   2. ~/.config/ocp-doc-scanner/blocklist.yaml (user-level)
#   3. ./scripts/blocklist.yaml (project-level)

blocklist:
  # Format: org/repo-name (full repository name)
  # Example repos to skip:
  - openshift/example-archived-repo
  - openshift/test-repository
  - openshift-kni/special-handling-repo
  
  # You can add comments for each entry to explain why it's blocklisted:
  - redhat-openshift-ecosystem/private-repo  # Access issues
  - openshift/deprecated-project              # No longer maintained
  
  # The script will skip these repos entirely during scanning,
  # saving time and avoiding errors for repos you don't want to process.
